## Resource Hints

This specification defines <code>preconnect</code>, <code>preload</code>, and <code>prerender</code> hints that the developer, or the server generating or delivering the resources, can use in an interoperable way to assist the user agent in the decision process of which origins it should connect to, which resources it should fetch to improve performance, and which resources may be required by the next navigation.
