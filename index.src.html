Abstract: This specification defines <code>preconnect</code>, <code>preload</code>, <code>prefetch</code>, and <code>prerender</code> hints that the developer, or the server generating or delivering the resources, can use in an interoperable way to assist the user agent in the decision process of which origins it should connect to, which resources it should fetch to improve performance, and which resources may be required by the next navigation.

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

Modern browsers leverage a wide variety of speculative optimization techniques to anticipate user input and intent, which allows them to hide some of the networking, processing, and rendering latencies: preconnects, early fetching of resources, prefetching of resources for subsequent navigation, and full page prerendering.

The decision to initiate one or more of the above optimization is typically based on heuristic rules based on document markup and structure, navigation history, and context of the user - e.g. type of device, available compute, memory, and network connectivity, user preferences, and so on. These techniques have proven to be successful, but can be further improved by leveraging the application and page specific knowledge of the developer or the servers responsible for generation and delivery of these resources.

For example, the application may provide the following resource hints to the user agent:

<ul>
  <li>The list of origins from which resources will be fetched.
  <li>The list of resources that will be used to construct the page.
  <li>The next user action or navigation target, and the resources that will be required, based on current page or application state, individual user history, or aggregated session data.
</ul>

Many web applications already leverage a variety prefetching techniques, such as using <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> to prefetch and cache assets before they are needed. However, these implementations are app-specific, are not interoperable with the browser-provided primitives, and do not provide the same level of performance, or worse, conflict and result in delayed or unnecessary downloads that degrade overall page performance.

This specification defines <code>preconnect</code>, <code>preload</code>, <code>prefetch</code>, and <code>prerender</code> hints that the developer, or the server generating or delivering the resources, can use in an interoperable way to assist the user agent in the decision process of which origins it should connect to, which resources it should fetch to improve performance, and which resources may be required by the next navigation.


<h2 id="resource-hints">Resource Hints</h2>

Resource hints are advisory and are used to assist the user agent in the decision making process of which optimizations can be applied when the page is being loaded, or as the user is interacting with the application.

<ul>
  <li><b>Preconnect</b> is used to indicate origins from which resources will be fetched.</li>
  <li><b>Preload</b> is used to indicate resources that should be fetched as early as possible.</li>
  <li><b>Prefetch</b> is used to indicate resources that will be required in the future.</li>
  <li><b>Prerender</b> is used to indicate the next navigation target.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="preconnect">Preconnect</h3>

The <code>preconnect</code> hint is used to indicate an origin that will be used to fetch required resources. Initiating an early connection, which includes the DNS lookup, TCP handshake, and optional TLS negotiation, allows the user agent to mask the high costs of connection establishment latency.

<pre>
  &lt;link rel="preconnect" href="//example.com"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preconnect" href="//cdn.example.com"&gt;
</pre>

The optimal number of connections per origin is dependent on the negotiated protocol, users current connectivity profile, available device resources, and other context specific variables. As a result, this decision is deferred to the user agent, which is in the best position to determine the optimal number.

The user agent should perform the full connection handshake (DNS+TCP for HTTP, and DNS+TCP+TLS for HTTPS origins) whenever possible, but is allowed to elect to perform a partial handshake (DNS only for HTTP, and DNS or DNS+TCP for HTTPS origins) due to resource constraints or other reasons.

<div class="note">
Many existing user agents implement <code>dns-prefetch</code> that only performs the DNS lookup. However, there are no circumstances where a standalone DNS lookup is useful unless you also intend to connect to the specified origin, and further, the bulk of the latency cost remains in the TCP and TLS handshakes. As a result, existing <code>dns-prefetch</code> hints can be treated as <code>preconnect</code> hints.
</div>

<div class="example">
The full resource URL may not be known until the page is being constructed by the user agent - e.g. conditional loading logic, UA adaptation, etc. However, the origin from which one or more of these resources will be fetched is often known ahead of time by the developer or the server generating the response. In such cases, a <code>preconnect</code> hint can be used to initiate an early connection handshake such that when the resource URL is determined, the user agent can dispatch the request without first blocking on connection negotiation.
</div>

<div class="example">
Many sites rely on redirects for analytics and to anonymize the referrer before sending the user to the final destination. Because the destination is known ahead of time, a preconnect hint can be used to initiate the connection handshake with the destination origin in parallel with the processing of the redirect.

Note that this behavior requires ability to dynamically inject a preconnect hint (e.g. as part of a JavaScript handler), and for the preconnect processing to proceed across page navigations.
</div>


<h3 id="preload">Preload</h3>

The <code>preload</code> hint is used to indicate the URL and content-type of a resource that should be fetched as early as possible by the user agent. Initiating an early fetch allows the user agent to mask the request latency of the resource and make it available sooner to the application.

<pre>
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="//example.com/font.woff" type="font/woff"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="//example.com/logo.webp" type="image/webp"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preload" href="//example.com/app.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;
</pre>

The <code>type</code> attribute specifies the content-type of the resource such that the user agent can set and communicate the right priority value when the request is initiated. The priority is set by the user agent and must match the priority value set by the document or speculative parsers when processing a resource of the same content-type. If the content-type is missing, the user agent should assign a default low priority to the specified resource.

<div class="example">
Speculative parsers do not execute JavaScript and perform a shallow parse of CSS, which means that the fetch of resources specified within JavaScript and CSS is delayed until the document parser is able to process the resource declaration. By using a <code>preload</code> hint the application can declaratively specify which resources the user agent should fetch early to mask the request latency and improve page performance.
</div>

<div class="example">
The <code>preload</code> hint can be generated both by the application and an optimization proxy (e.g. a CDN) to accelerate fetch and delivery of required resources.

<ol>
  <li>The application can specify <code>preload</code> hints, allowing:
    <ul>
      <li>The optimization proxy to initiate early fetch of the associated resources and place them into its cache, thus reducing or eliminating the latency of retrieving resources from the origin.
      <li>The user agent to initiate early fetch of required resources - see example above.
    </ul>

  <li>The optimization proxy can specify <code>preload</code> hints on behalf of the application:
    <ul>
      <li>The proxy can observe and infer required resources based on past request patterns, allowing it to automate generation of relevant <code>preload</code> hints to improve performance.
      <li>The proxy can deliver inferred <code>preload</code> hints to the user agent while it is blocked on the response from the origin, allowing the user agent to begin fetching required resources.
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
      Many optimization proxies already implement the "early flush" strategy where references to required resources are delivered to the user agent while the proxy is blocked on the response from the origin. Today, this is typically done by synthesizing a document <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> that contains XHR, image, and object requests. However, in practice, these implementations often result in prioritization conflicts with requests initiated by speculative and document parsers, or worse, result in delayed or double downloads due to missing content-type information.

      The <code>preload</code> hint addresses these problems by providing a declarative hint that communicates both the URL and the content-type of the resource.
    </div>
</ol>
</div>


<h3 id="prefetch">Prefetch</h3>

The <code>prefetch</code> hint is used to indicate the URL and content-type of a resource that is likely to be a required resource when the next action or navigation is triggered. Initiating an early fetch allows the user agent to mask the request latency of the resource and make it available sooner to the application.

<pre>
  &lt;link rel="prefetch" href="//example.com/thankyou.html" type="text/html"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="prefetch" href="//example.com/thankyou.webp" type="image/webp"&gt;
</pre>

Specified <code>prefetch</code> resources should not negatively impact the performance of the current page:

<ul>
  <li>The priority of <code>prefetch</code> requests should be lower than that of resources required by the current page.
    <ul>
      <li>The <code>type</code> attribute specifies the content-type of the resource such that the user agent can set and communicate the right priority value relative to other <code>prefetch</code> resources. If the content-type is missing, the user agent should assign a default low priority to the specified resource.
    </ul>
  <li>The optimal time to initiate the resource fetch is dependent on the negotiated protocol, users current connectivity profile, available device resources, and other context specific variables. As a result, this decision is deferred to the user agent, which is in the best position to determine the optimal time - e.g. the user agent may decide to wait until all other downloads are finished, or choose to pipeline requests with low priority if the negotiated protocol supports the necessary primitives.
</ul>

The user agent should not cancel outstanding <code>prefetch</code> requests when a new navigation is triggered as they may be required by the next page. However, the user agent may cancel these requests once it determines that they are not required by the new destination.

<div class="example">
The <code>prefetch</code> hint can be used to implement a prefetch strategy that leverages app-specific knowledge about the next navigation.

For example, an image gallery may have knowledge about the likelihood of next photo or page that may be requested by the user. To provide an improved experience the application can ask the user agent to begin fetching required resources before the next navigation is triggered.

Alternatively, instead of anticipating user activity, the application can react to user input and dynamically schedule prefetch requests based on its knowledge of resources that will be required by the next navigation target - i.e. the application may capture a click event and provide <code>prefetch</code> hints to the user agent before the current page is unloaded.
</div>


<h3 id="prerender">Prerender</h3>

The <code>prerender</code> hint is used to indicate the URL of the next navigation target. Initiating a prerender allows the user agent to deliver an instant navigation experience: the user agent downloads the top-level resource and its assets, and performs all of the processing steps required to show the page without actually showing it to the user. Then, once the navigation is triggered, the prerendered content is seamlessly swapped in place of the current page.

<pre>
  &lt;link rel="prerender" href="//example.com/article/part2.html"&gt;
</pre>

<div class="example">
The <code>prerender</code> hint can be used by the application to signal high-likelihood navigation targets based on content, structure, analytics, or other signals - e.g. high-likelihood search results, paginated content or step-driven flows, aggregated analytics or per-user behavior, and so on.
</div>

Specified <code>prerender</code> target should not negatively impact the performance of the current page. Due to the need to download, parse, and execute the target resource and its assets, prerendering may result in high contention for CPU, GPU, memory, and network resources. As a result, the user agent may implement various strategies to minimize resource contention and impose limits on the properties of the content that is being prerendered:

<ul>
  <li>To minimize resource contention the prerendered content may be processed with lower priority.
    <ul>
      <li>The background render may be allocated fewer CPU, GPU, or memory resources.
      <li>The priority of all <code>prerender</code> requests should be lower than that of resources required by the current page and the optimal time to initiate these requests is deferred to the user agent.
      <li>Some resource requests may be delayed until the prerendered page is made visible - e.g. media downloads, plugin content, and so on.
    </ul>

  <li>Prerender may be abandoned due to resource constraints.
    <ul>
      <li>Limited available resources may prevent prerender from being initiated.
      <li>High resource requirements of the content being prerendered may lead the user agent to cancel the prerender - e.g. exceeded memory requirements, high CPU usage, and so on.
    </ul>

  <li>Prerender may be abandoned based on the type or properties of the prerendered content.
    <ul>
      <li>If the target exhibits non-idempotent behavior: mutations to shared local storage, XMLHttpRequest with a verb other than GET, HEAD, or OPTION, and so on.
      <li>If the target triggers a condition that requires user input: confirmation dialogs, authentication prompts, alerts, and so on.
    </ul>
</ul>

Note: The above examples are not an exhaustive list. The decision which strategies to implement and how to enforce them is deferred to the user agent. For a hands-on example, see <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/prerender">Chromium prerendering</a> wiki page.

To ensure compatibility and improve success rate of prerender requests the target page should use the [[PAGE-VISIBILITY]] to determine the visibility state of the page as it is being rendered and implement appropriate logic to avoid actions that may cause the prerender to be abandoned (e.g. non-idempotent requests), or unwanted side-effects from being triggered (e.g. analytics beacons firing prior to the page being displayed).


<h2 id="processing">Processing model</h2>
<h3 id="best-effort-processing">Best-effort processing</h3>

The presence of a resource hint does not guarantee that the user agent will execute the specified optimization. The decision to invoke the optimization is deferred to the user agent based on page, user, and system contexts.

<ul>
  <li>The user agent may decide to execute none, some, or all of the optimizations provided via resource hints, and may also invoke additional optimizations based on its own heuristics.

  <li>The user agent may decide to execute a partial optimization relative to the specified hint due to resource constraints or other reasons.
    <ul>
      <li><code>preconnect</code> may fallback to a partial handshake (DNS only, or DNS+TCP for HTTPS origins).
      <li><code>preload</code> may fallback to <code>preconnect</code> for specified origin.
      <li><code>prefetch</code> may fallback to <code>preconnect</code> for specified origin.
      <li><code>prerender</code> may fallback to a mixed strategy for the target page and its resources: <code>preconnect</code> only; <code>prefetch</code> the target page but defer fetch of resources; <code>prefetch</code> subresources but delay their execution, and so on.
    </ul>
</ul>

Note: <code>preload</code> and <code>prefetch</code> hints serve as implicit <code>preconnect</code> hints since a connection is required to fetch the resource; a <code>prerender</code> hint serves as an implicit <code>prefetch</code> hint, and so on. Performing a partial optimization allows the user agent to improve performance even if a full optimization cannot be performed.


<h3 id="dynamic-scheduling">Dynamic scheduling</h3>

In addition to the hints specified in the document markup, the application may have runtime resource hints based on user context or other signals. The user agent should process dynamically inserted resource hints in addition to and in the same way as document specified hints.

<pre>
  &lt;!-- insert new prerender hint --&gt;
  var hint = document.createElement("link")
  hint.setAttribute("rel", "prerender")
  hint.setAttribute("href", "/article/part3.html")
  document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(hint)

  &lt;!-- cancel prerender --&gt;
  document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].removeChild(hint);
</pre>

The removal of the hint from the document should cancel the optimization if it is being processed and prevent it from executing if it has not yet been invoked.


<h3 id="http-link">Interoperability with HTTP Link header</h3>

The user agent should process resource hints specified via the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988"><code>Link</code> HTTP header</a>.

<pre>
  Link: &lt;https://example.com&gt;; rel=preconnect
  Link: &lt;https://example.com/font.woff&gt;; rel=preload; type=font/woff
  Link: &lt;https://example.com/thankyou.html&gt;; rel=prefetch; type=text/html
  Link: &lt;https://example.com/article/part2.html&gt;; rel=prerender
</pre>

The application may provide one or more of the same type of hint via multiple HTTP headers or via a comma separated list. The user agent should process such hints in addition to and in the same way as document specified and dynamically scheduled resource hints.

<div class="example">
Delivering resource hints via <code>Link</code> header allows automated optimization services running on origin or upstream servers (e.g. CDN) to leverage and emit resource hints without modifying the delivered response.

  <ul>
    <li>The optimization service may leverage specified hints to preconnect, preload, or prefetch resources into its own cache, which will assist in faster delivery when the request arrives from the client.
    <li>The optimization service may emit resource hints based own optimization heuristics (e.g. inferred page structure, request patterns, and so on) to assist the user agent.
  </ul>
</div>


<h3 id="caching-grace-period">Caching grace period</h3>

Resources fetched via <code>preload</code>, <code>prefetch</code>, and <code>prerender</code> are subject to regular HTTP caching and processing rules. However, special handling of some caching directives (e.g. <code>no-cache</code>, <code>no-store</code>, <code>max-age=0</code>) is required to avoid double downloads and unnecessary revalidation requests.

For example, a resource is fetched via <code>preload</code> contains a <code>no-cache</code> directive. When the application dispatches the request to fetch this resource (via <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> or other means), the default user agent behavior would be to dispatch a revalidation or a duplicate download request before the response can be returned to the application, which is unnecessary and defeats the purpose of the resource hint.

To address this, resources fetched via <code>preload</code>, <code>prefetch</code>, and <code>prerender</code> should have a grace period of 300 seconds  during which the fetched response can be used to fulfill application requests without unnecessary revalidation or download requests.

Note: grace period TBD, 300 seconds is the current Chrome default for prerender and prefetch requests.
