Abstract: This specification defines <code>preconnect</code>, <code>preload</code>, <code>prefetch</code>, and <code>prerender</code> hints that the developer, or the server generating or delivering the resources, can use in an interoperable way to assist the browser in the decision process of which origins it should connect to, identification of critical resources, and which resources or pages may be required in the future.

<h2 id='intro'>Introduction</h2>

Modern browsers leverage a wide variety of speculative optimization techniques to anticipate user input and intent, which allows them to hide some of the networking, processing, and rendering latencies: preconnects, early fetching of critical resources, prefetching of resources for subsequent navigation, and full page prerendering.

The decision to initiate one or more of the above optimization is typically based on heuristic rules based on document markup and structure, navigation history, and context of the user - e.g. type of device, available compute, memory, and network connectivity, user preferences, and so on. These techniques have proven to be successful, but can be further improved by leveraging the application and page specific knowledge of the developer or the servers responsible for generation and delivery of these resources.

For example, the application may provide the following resource hints to the browser:

<ul>
  <li>The list of origins from which critical resources will be fetched.
  <li>The list of critical resources that will be used to construct the page.
  <li>The next user action or navigation target, and the resources that will be required, based on current page or application state, individual user history, or aggregated session data.
</ul>

Many web applications already leverage a variety prefetching techniques, such as using <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> to prefetch and cache assets before they are needed. However, these implementations are app-specific, are not interoperable with the browser-provided primitives, and do not provide the same level of performance, or worse, conflict and result in delayed or unnecessary downloads that degrade overall page performance.

This specification defines <code>preconnect</code>, <code>preload</code>, <code>prefetch</code>, and <code>prerender</code> hints that the developer, or the server generating or delivering the resources, can use in an interoperable way to assist the browser in the decision process of which origins it should connect to, identification of critical resources, and which resources or pages may be required in the future.


<h2 id='resource-hints'>Resource Hints</h2>

Resource hints are advisory and are used to assist the user agent in the decision making process of which optimizations can be applied when the page is being loaded, or as the user is interacting with the application.

<ul>
  <li><b>Preconnect</b> is used to indicate origins from which critical resources will be fetched.</li>
  <li><b>Preload</b> is used to indicate critical resources that should be fetched as early as possible.</li>
  <li><b>Prefetch</b> is used to indicate resources that will be required in the future.</li>
  <li><b>Prerender</b> is used to indicate the next navigation target.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id='preconnect'>Preconnect</h3>

The <code>preconnect</code> hint is used to indicate an origin that will be used to fetch required resources. Initiating an early connection, which includes the DNS lookup, TCP handshake, and optional TLS negotiation, allows the user agent to mask the high costs of connection establishment latency.

<pre class="prod">
  &lt;link rel="preconnect" href="//example.com"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="preconnect" href="//cdn.example.com"&gt;
</pre>

The optimal number of connections per origin is dependent on the negotiated protocol, users current connectivity profile, available device resources, and other context-specific variables. As a result, this decision is deferred to the user agent, which is in the best position to determine the optimal number.

<div class="note">
Many existing user agents implement <code>dns-prefetch</code> that only performs the DNS lookup. However, there are no circumstances where a standalone DNS lookup is useful unless you also intend to connect to the specified origin, and further, the bulk of the latency cost remains in the TCP and TLS handshakes.

As a result, existing <code>dns-prefetch</code> hints can be treated as <code>preconnect</code> hints. The user agent may choose to perform a partial handshake (DNS only for HTTP, or DNS+TCP for HTTPS origins) based on implemented heuristics, but it should attempt to complete the full connection handshake (DNS+TCP for HTTP, and DNS+TCP+TLS for HTTPS origins) whenever possible to deliver the best results.

<div class='example'>
The exact URL of a critical resource may not be known until the page is being constructed by the user agent - e.g. conditional loading logic, UA adaptation, etc. However, the origin from which one or more of these resources will be fetched is often known ahead of time by the developer or the server generating the response. In such cases, a <code>preconnect</code> hint can be used to initiate an early connection handshake such that when the resource URL is determined, the user agent can immediately dispatch the request without first blocking on connection negotiation.
</div>

<div class='example'>
Many sites rely on redirects for analytics and to anonymize the referrer before sending the user to the final destination. Because the destination is known ahead of time, a preconnect hint can be used to initiate the connection handshake with the destination origin in parallel with the processing of the redirect.

Note that this behavior requires ability to dynamically inject a preconnect hint (e.g. as part of a JavaScript handler), and for the preconnect processing to proceed across page navigations.

Resource hints may be automatically downgraded by the user agent due to resource constraints or other reasons - e.g. instead of completing the full preload the user agent may opt out to only perform a preconnect for the hostname of the critical resource.
